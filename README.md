# Tiny habits backend

This is the backend for the tiny habit react native app. This app is created with express, node.js, and postgresql.

# ToDo

- Add behavior model: id, content: text, motivated: 1-5, easy: 1-5
- One aspiration can have many behaviors
- A behavior belongs to aspiration
- Get the correct aspiration when creating a behavior (PARAMS? BUT HOW DO I GET IT?)
